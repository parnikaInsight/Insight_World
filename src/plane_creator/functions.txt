// create world with 2 gltf entities, not cubes
// spawn transparent cube with gizmo at center of gltf and link gltf transform to cube's

// world snapshot OR save world as a list of gltf entities and their transforms
// save to db_worlds folder
// retrieve world from assets and respawn scene
// add panel with already loaded gltfs that map to their spawning

// click animations sequentially to map to ability creation
// animation control
// transform control
// object spawning
// health manipulation

// Later:
// dynamically loading gltfs through ui panel
// serialize code and put into database
